# Algorithms Study
In this repo I'm trying to compile all the alogorithms I'm studying for personal growth. 

1. How I got started with project
- Installed node.js version 13
- I created an empty directory (mkdir algos)
- added package.json by (npm init)
- added jest by (npm install --save-dev jest)
